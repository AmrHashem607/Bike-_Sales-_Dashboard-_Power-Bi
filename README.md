 Complete Data Analysis Project Using Power BI
I’ve recently completed a full Power BI project based on 5 connected datasets (Customers, Products, Sales, Regions, and Resellers).
 The dashboard includes 4 interactive pages covering:
Sales performance by region and customer 🗺️
Product and profit analysis 💰
Reseller insights 📦
Overall business performance overview 📊
Throughout the project, I worked with:
Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
Relationships & DAX for data modeling
Interactive visuals for storytelling and insights
This project helped me turn raw data into a smart, decision-driven dashboard, enhancing my skills in Data Analysis & Business Intelligence.
